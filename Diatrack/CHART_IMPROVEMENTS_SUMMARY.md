# Chart Improvements & Icon Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Font Awesome Icons
**Problem**: Icons were not displaying properly throughout the application.

**Solution**: Added Font Awesome 6.4.0 CDN link to `index.html`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css" />
```

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html` - Added Font Awesome CDN link
- `Dashboard.css` - Removed redundant Font Awesome import from CSS

### 2. Added Risk Filter to Patient Detail Charts
**Feature**: Users can now filter health metrics charts by risk classification.

**Implementation**:
- Added `RiskFilter` component to the History Charts section in patient detail view
- Created state variable `selectedMetricsFilter` to track the selected filter
- Implemented `filteredPatientMetrics` using React.useMemo for efficient filtering
- Filter options: All, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, PPD

**Files Modified**:
- `Dashboard.jsx`:
  - Added `selectedMetricsFilter` state
  - Added `filteredPatientMetrics` memoized filter
  - Integrated RiskFilter component in History Charts section
  - Updated all three charts to use filtered data

### 3. Enhanced Chart Axis Labels
**Problem**: Charts had no axis labels, making it hard to understand the data.

**Solution**: Added proper axis titles and visible tick marks:

#### Blood Glucose Chart:
- **X-axis**: "Date" with visible date labels (45° rotation)
- **Y-axis**: "Blood Glucose (mg/dL)" with visible scale

#### Blood Pressure Chart:
- **X-axis**: "Date" with visible date labels (45° rotation)
- **Y-axis**: "Blood Pressure (mmHg)" with visible scale

#### Risk Classification Chart:
- **X-axis**: "Date" with visible date labels (45° rotation)
- **Y-axis**: "Risk Level" with custom labels (PPD, Low, Moderate, High)

**Files Modified**:
- `Dashboard.jsx` - Updated chart options for all three charts
- `Dashboard.css` - Added comprehensive chart styling

---

### 4. Improved Chart Data Display
**Changes**:
- Increased data points from 5 to 10 for better trend visualization
- All charts now use `filteredPatientMetrics` instead of `allPatientHealthMetrics`
- Charts update dynamically when filter is changed
- Better responsive design for mobile devices

---

### 5. Enhanced CSS Styling
**New Styles Added** (`Dashboard.css`):
- `.history-charts-section` - Main container styling
- `.blood-glucose-chart-container`, `.blood-pressure-chart-container`, `.risk-classification-chart-container` - Individual chart containers
- `.risk-legend-container` & `.risk-legend-item` - Risk legend styling
- `.chart-wrapper` - Proper chart sizing and background
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
